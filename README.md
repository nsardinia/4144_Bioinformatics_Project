## Question Posed
Can early gene expression profiles in hFib-MYOD cells predict whether a cell will successfully complete myogenic reprogramming?

_Can we distinguish a fully reprogrammed cell from others and if done successfully could we predict whether a cell will reprogram successfully by looking at prior time series steps?_

## Database
### Aligning single-cell developmental and reprogramming trajectories identifies molecular determinants of reprogramming outcome

### What is hFib-MYOD?
hFib-MYOD is a specific line of human foreskin fibroblasts (hFib) genetically engineered to convert into myotube-like cells (precursors to muscle fibers) upon doxycycline induction, making it a model for cellular reporogramming.

### What is myogenic reprogramming?
The process of converting cell types like fibroblasts into muscle cells (myocytes) by forcing the expression of myogenic regulatory factors like MYOD.
