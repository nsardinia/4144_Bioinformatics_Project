#### What is hTERT?
hTERT is a catalytic component of human telomerase. It is undetectable in normal cells but there is a spike of hTERT in cancer and stem cells where telomere length is maintained by _telomerase_ (cellular enzyme that adds repetitve DNA sequences to the ends of chromosomes, telomeres).
