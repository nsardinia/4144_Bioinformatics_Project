The data sets includes 43405 genes from 658 samples with little variance. The data had a lower variance of
about 0.85 with the total range of log scaled data spanning from about 0.45 to 7.58. A vast majority of the
data is centralized between 0 and 1 (about 80%) with some outliers skewing the data towards the right. This
shows that most of the data values are similar.
