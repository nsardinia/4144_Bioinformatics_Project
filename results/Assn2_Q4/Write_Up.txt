The heatmaps show distinct groups between the initial time t0 and the final time t72. Also, there is very
high gene expression when analyzing change between t24 and t48. This could be where the cells start to rapidly
reprogram if all the genes become more expressed. Overall, gene expression increases with time, but has a large
spike between 24 and 48 hours before lowering down towards 0.
