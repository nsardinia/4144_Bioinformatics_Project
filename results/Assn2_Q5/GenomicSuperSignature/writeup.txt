I used the GenomicSuperSignature library to validate the dataset to identify which publicly available, gene expression patterns (RAVs) are most relevant to the dataset.
By comparing the expression profiles against the RAVs, we can highlights the key pathways or biological processes that are strongly represented in the data. 
The top matching signals, can be interpreted in terms of their associated functions or disease relevance, providing insight into the underlying biology.
Using GenomicSuperSignature, there is no way to explicitly run analyses with a specific ontology (Gene, Disease), but the strongest correlated RAVs can be examined for their annotations to infer which biological pathways, processes, or disease associations are most relevant.
